# Return
**Project Name:** Return \
**App Name:** GivingBack \
**Backend Repo:** https://github.com/Hoo-dkwozD/GivingBackApp-BackEnd \
This project aims to make volunteering easier, widespread, and more beneficial to those in need. GivingBack will be developed with an innovative approach to these 2 separate approaches, an enhanced volunteer referral system, and a streamlined volunteer mechanism. We believe these areas can all be addressed within a single mobile app.

## Prerequisites


- [Node.js > 12](https://nodejs.org) and npm
- [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman)
- [Xcode 12](https://developer.apple.com/xcode)
- [Cocoapods 1.10.1](https://cocoapods.org)
- [JDK > 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [Android Studio and Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio)

## Usage

### Using React-Native

Keep in mind that this library can cause trouble if you are renaming a project that uses `Pods` on the iOS side.

After that you should proceed as with any javascript project:

- Go to your project's root folder and run `npm install`.
- If you are using Xcode 12.5 or higher got to /ios and execute `pod install --`repo-update`
- Run `npm run ios` or `npm run android` to start your application!

(Using yarn: `yarn ios` or `yarn android`)

Note: Please read the Setup environments section that is below in this file for more information about the execution scripts.

## Splash screen customization

To customize the splash screen (logo and background color) use the CLI provided in the [official docs](https://github.com/zoontek/react-native-bootsplash#assets-generation).

## Setup environments

### Using scripts from console

The template already has scripts to execute the project calling a specific environment defined into the package.json file. Keep in mind that if you are going to create new `envs` you have to define the script to build the project properly.

To define which env you want to use, just keep the structure `yarn [platform]: [environment]`

DEV: `yarn ios` or `yarn android`

STG: `yarn ios:staging` or `yarn android:staging`

PROD: `yarn ios:prod` o `yarn android:prod`

Also, you can use npm following the same rule as before: `npm run ios:staging`

Modify the environment variables files in root folder (`.env.development`, `.env.production` and `.env.staging`)


#### Android

A map associating builds with env files is already defined in `app/build.gradle` you can modify or add environments if needed.

For multiple enviroments to work you would need to change `-keep class [YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME].BuildConfig { *; }` on `proguard-rules.pro` file.

#### iOS

The basic idea in iOS is to have one scheme per environment file, so you can easily alternate between them.

To create a new scheme:

- In the Xcode menu, go to Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme
- Click Duplicate Scheme on the bottom
- Give it a proper name on the top left. For instance: "qa"
- Then edit the newly created scheme to make it use a different env file. From the same "manage scheme" window:

  Expand the "Build" tab on the left menu
  - Click "Pre-actions", and under the plus sign select "New Run Script Action"
  - Where it says "Type a script or drag a script file", type: `echo ".env.qa" > /tmp/envfile` replacing `.env.qa` with your file.
- Also, you will need to select the executable for the new schema:

  Expand the "Run" tab on the left menu
  - Under the "Executable" dropdown select the ".app" you would like to use for that schema

## Generate production version

These are the steps to generate `.apk`, `.aab` and `.ipa` files

### Android

1. Generate an upload key
2. Setting up gradle variables
3. Go to the android folder
4. Execute `./gradlew assemble[Env][BuildType]`

Note: You have three options to execute the project
`assemble:` Generates an apk that you can share with others.
`install:` When you want to test a release build on a connected device.
`bundle:` When you are uploading the app to the Play Store.

### iOS

1. Go to the Xcode
2. Select the schema
3. Select 'Any iOS device' as target
4. Product -> Archive
